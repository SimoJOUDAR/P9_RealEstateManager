## About
This is my ninth project for Openclassrooms' **Android App Development program**.
This **Native Android App "RealEstateManager"** is, as the name indicates, a real estate management app ordered by a real estate company for attend their specific needs. 

It allows company's personnel to access their real estate offers (sales and rentals), to display an offer in details, to edit an existing offer or to create a new one and assign it to an agent, all from their mobile equipment. It offers also the functionalies to create an new agent profile, to display all real estates in a map view and to simulate a loan. The app is also multi currency view.
